 *  country’s currency and also the conversion rate.
 *  People use this application basically for business, shares, and finance-related areas 
 *  where currency exchange and money transfer happen daily. You get a preferred choice to 
 *  convert any country’s currency. Just enter the amount, the currency to which you want to 
 *  transform to, click enter and you get the output.

 * Technologies Required:  
 * Java programming language, Java Servlets Web Features, Applet, and Ajax.

 *  2. Brick Breaker Game
 * One of the pleasant ways to study technology is through implementing 
 * game applications. It may not be easy but developing this Java project 
 * will make you learn a lot of new things. This game development project 
 * will provide you with java experience and essential animation techniques 
 * with their integration.
 * Abstract: Many of you already heard of the brick breaker game. It has a 
 * small ball that knocks the bricks taking the help of a small platform at 
 * the base. The player handles this platform and tries to bounce the ball 
 * through that platform. In this project, the scoring depends on the number 
 * of bricked-broken, i.e., the more you destroy the bricks, the more you score.
 * If you missed the chance for the ball to bounce, then the game is over. 
 * This project is basically for beginners who are looking for a minor project.
 * This simple project will surely help you with your first-year project or 
 * also as an implementation for fun purposes. 
 * 
 * Technologies Required: 
 * Java, Game development, JFrame, JPanel, and Java Graphics Kit. 
 *

 *  3. Attendance Management System
 * An attendance management system is one of the major projects for 
 * university-level graduates. The project can be built using Java, 
 * the MVC architecture could be followed, and Maven as a built tool. 
 * It uses MySQL as a backend for database management and uses a tomcat 
 * server to deploy the application in order to see it working live.
 * Abstract: This project is a web application that manages the attendance 
 * of any student in school or college, also employees in an organization. 
 * It has an admin feature that holds the access to do any kind of changes 
 * like update, delete, and add user records to the list.
 * 
 * Various users of the application where users can access are:
    Admin
    Student
    Faculty

* Technologies Required:  
* Java Servlet  , MVC architecture, Maven  MySQL  , Tomcat Server JSP,  
* HTML  ,  CSS  , and  JavaScript  .

 * 100 or 1 to 1000. Also, if the number you’ve guessed is high or low to the 
 * actual value, the application sends you an alert “Too High” or “Too Low”. 
 * After the limited attempt is completed, the actual value is revealed.
 * 
 * Technologies Required:  Java Programming Language and  Random Class in Java  .
